# Micro-Reddit

This project is a simple clone of reddit with the features where user can creat and comment on a post. The goal of the project is to learn about models and association using Active Records gem. There is no user interface, it can only be interact/experiment with inside `rails console`.

Created as part of The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-with-active-record-ruby-on-rails#project-2-micro-reddit)
